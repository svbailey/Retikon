# V3.1 Sprint 09 - Query performance acceleration

Dates: TBD
Owner: TBD

## Goal
Reduce multimodal tail latency with optimized runtimes and tiered query services.

## Scope checklist
- [ ] Add ONNX/quantized embedding backends in retikon_core/embeddings/.
- [ ] Add GPU query service profile/entrypoint in gcp_adapter/ and deploy via Terraform.
- [ ] Add query routing by modality/SLA tier in retikon_core/query_engine/ and adapters.
- [ ] Add SLO load tests for text-only vs multimodal queries in Dev Docs/Load-Testing.md.

## Primary paths
- `retikon_core/embeddings/`
- `retikon_core/query_engine/`
- `gcp_adapter/`
- `infrastructure/terraform/`
- `Dev Docs/Load-Testing.md`

## Tests and validation
- [ ] `tests/test_embedding_backends.py`
- [ ] `tests/test_query_routing.py`

## Deliverables
- [ ] CPU-optimized (ONNX/quantized) and GPU query tiers available in Pro.
- [ ] Documented routing rules and performance baselines.

## Risks / Dependencies
- [ ] Requires GPU-capable build pipeline and cost controls.
