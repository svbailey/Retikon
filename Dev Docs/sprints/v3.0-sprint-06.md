# V3.0 Sprint 06 - Edge gateway + adaptive buffering (Pro)

Dates: TBD
Owner: TBD

## Goal
Managed edge gateway with store-and-forward behavior.

## Scope checklist
- [x] Add edge gateway service in gcp_adapter/edge_gateway_service.py.
- [x] Implement buffering policies in retikon_core/edge/buffer.py (TTL, disk cap, replay).
- [x] Add adaptive batching/backpressure controls in retikon_core/edge/policies.py.
- [x] Add gateway config endpoints in gcp_adapter/edge_gateway_service.py.
- [x] Update Terraform for gateway service in infrastructure/terraform/.

## Primary paths
- `gcp_adapter/edge_gateway_service.py`
- `retikon_core/edge/buffer.py`
- `retikon_core/edge/policies.py`
- `infrastructure/terraform/`

## Tests and validation
- [x] `tests/test_edge_buffering.py`
- [x] `tests/test_edge_gateway.py`

## Deliverables
- [x] Managed gateway with offline buffering policies

## Risks / Dependencies
- [ ] TBD

## Notes
- Tests: `pytest -q`
