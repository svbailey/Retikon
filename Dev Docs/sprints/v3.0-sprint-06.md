# V3.0 Sprint 06 - Edge gateway + adaptive buffering (Pro)

Dates: TBD
Owner: TBD

## Goal
Managed edge gateway with store-and-forward behavior.

## Scope checklist
- [ ] Add edge gateway service in gcp_adapter/edge_gateway_service.py.
- [ ] Implement buffering policies in retikon_core/edge/buffer.py (TTL, disk cap, replay).
- [ ] Add adaptive batching/backpressure controls in retikon_core/edge/policies.py.
- [ ] Add gateway config endpoints in gcp_adapter/edge_gateway_service.py.
- [ ] Update Terraform for gateway service in infrastructure/terraform/.

## Primary paths
- `gcp_adapter/edge_gateway_service.py`
- `retikon_core/edge/buffer.py`
- `retikon_core/edge/policies.py`
- `infrastructure/terraform/`

## Tests and validation
- [ ] `tests/test_edge_buffering.py`
- [ ] `tests/test_edge_gateway.py`

## Deliverables
- [ ] Managed gateway with offline buffering policies

## Risks / Dependencies
- [ ] TBD
