# v3.1 Finishers (Post‑Sprint Backlog)

Date: 2026-01-29
Owner: Eng + Product
Purpose: Track v3.1 scope that is still stubbed or partial so it stays visible
outside the v3.2 roadmap.

Status key:
- Stubbed: API exists but returns placeholder data.
- Partial: core scaffold exists but missing execution or integrations.

## Finishers not covered by v3.2

### 1) Pro: OCR connector hook (stubbed)
- Status: Completed (2026-01-29).
- Paths:
  - `gcp_adapter/data_factory_service.py`
  - `retikon_core/connectors/registry.yml` (add OCR connector entry + schema)
- Tasks:
  - Define OCR connector config schema + validation.
  - Persist OCR connector config (Core registry + Pro storage).
  - Implement OCR ingestion pipeline integration (Pro).
  - Add API tests (`tests/pro/test_data_factory_service.py`).

### 2) Pro: Office conversion pipeline (.doc/.ppt)
- Status: Completed (2026-01-29).
- Paths:
  - `gcp_adapter/data_factory_service.py`
  - Add converter implementation (Pro-only).
- Tasks:
  - Implement converter service (e.g., LibreOffice headless) or managed GCP flow.
  - Add conversion job queue + DLQ handling.
  - Add tests (`tests/pro/test_document_conversion.py`).

### 3) Pro: Workflow scheduler / execution
- Status: Completed (2026-01-29).
- Paths:
  - `retikon_core/workflows/` (types + store)
  - `gcp_adapter/workflow_service.py` (API)
- Tasks:
  - Add scheduler/runner (cron + async execution).
  - Implement step execution hooks (ingest, export, webhook, etc.).
  - Add run state machine + retries.
  - Add Pro tests (`tests/pro/test_workflow_service.py`).

### 4) Core: Training orchestration (beyond scaffold)
- Status: Completed (2026-01-29).
- Paths:
  - `retikon_core/data_factory/training.py`
- Tasks:
  - Add training job lifecycle + persistence.
  - Add queue/executor interface (Core) and Pro runner.
  - Add tests (`tests/core/test_model_registry.py` + new training tests).

### 5) Core: Redaction beyond text (future‑ready stubs)
- Status: Completed (2026-01-29).
- Paths:
  - `retikon_core/redaction/`
- Tasks:
  - Define image/video/audio redaction policy types (stubs OK).
  - Add opt‑in pipeline hooks (no‑op by default).
  - Add tests for policy plumbing (no heavy ML).

## Finishers already planned in v3.2 (tracked there)

### A) Managed connectors + scheduler (Pro)
- Covered in v3.2 Sprint 2.
- Paths:
  - `gcp_adapter/` + `infrastructure/terraform/`

### B) Connector SDK + CLI + registry validation (Core)
- Covered in v3.2 Sprint 1.
- Paths:
  - `retikon_core/connectors/`
  - `retikon_cli/`

### C) Pro: BYOC adapter maturity (K8s)
- Deferred to v3.2 Sprint 00 (carryover closeout).
- Paths:
  - `k8s_adapter/`
  - `retikon_core/providers/`

### D) Pro: GPU tier deployment
- Deferred to v3.2 Sprint 00 (carryover closeout).
- Paths:
  - `infrastructure/terraform/`
  - `gcp_adapter/`

## Notes
- GPU tier is disabled for cost control; deferred to v3.2 Sprint 00 for
  re‑enablement after latency/cost tradeoff is validated (see
  `Dev Docs/pro/Load-Testing.md`).
