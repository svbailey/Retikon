# Feature/Function Catalog Split

Date: 2026-01-28

This folder splits the main catalog into per-feature and per-module documents.
- Feature summaries: `features-core.md`, `features-pro.md`, `features-planned-v3.1.md`, `features-planned-v3.2.md`
- Function docs: `core/`, `pro/`, `other/` mirror the repo paths and describe functions/classes per file.
