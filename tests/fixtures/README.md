# Test Fixtures

Small fixtures for ingestion pipeline tests and smoke checks.

- `sample.docx` and `sample.xlsx` are minimal OpenXML packages.
- `sample.pptx` is a minimal OpenXML package with enough text for parsing.
- `sample.png`, `sample.jpg`, `sample.mp4`, and `sample.wav` were generated via
  `ffmpeg` or a short PCM generator (images are 256x256).
